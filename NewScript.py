    # autoencoder is a combination of an encoder (compressed input) and a decoder (decompression output)
    # The input will be a grayscale image and output will be a RGB image.
    # During encoding phase, used convolution layers with LeakyReLU activation.
    # Increased the number of filters as these layers are added.
    # For decoding steps, used UpSampling layer followed by convolution layer.
    # The basic idea is that the encoding phase takes an input and compresses the input by passing it through
    # different convolutional layers. Now using this compressed representation of the input,
    # the decoding phase produces the final output. During decoding phase, transposed convolution layers or upsampling
    # layers are typically used. Because the decoding phase only sees the compressed representation of original input,
